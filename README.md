# ShapeUp

A 3D Modeling tool using constructive solid geometry. More information about the project [on my website](https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/shapeup/)

This was written for the 2023 [Wheel reinvention Jam](https://handmade.network/jam/2023). As such, the project is not maintained. This repo exists just because a few people said they were interested in looking at the code for educational purposes. If you have an issue building, I'll take a PR for that, otherwise I'm not accepting bug reports or new features.

This repo is a santitized copy of the original with commit history removed. I was never planning on doing a public release of this code, and I don't feel like auditing/changing the original repo's commit history for code/comments that shouldn't be public.  

# Building

for macOS run `make`  
for web: run `./webbuild.sh`  
for windows: open .sln or make sure msbuild is in your PATH and then run `msbuild`
